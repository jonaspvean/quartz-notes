In Rosencrans [CITE] the following symmetry definition is used:\nA symmetry of the evolution equation ut​=K is another equation us​=P such that\nDt​P=Ds​K\nwhich is the necessary and sufficient condition for u to be a simultaneous solution for both systems.\nFrom Olver [CITE], the condition for vP​ being a symmetry is\n∂t∂vP​​+[vP​,vK​]=0\nwhere vK​ is the evolutionary vector field associated with K:\nvK​=α=1∑q​Kα[u]∂uα∂​\nlikewise for vP​.\nWe shall see how these two different formalisms are linked.\nStarting from Rosencrans’ formalism, let vP​ denote the evolutionary vector field associated with P. Then\nDt​P=∂t∂P​+α,J∑​∂uJα​∂P​∂t∂uJα​​=∂t∂P​+α,J∑​∂uJα​∂P​∂J​Kα\nand similarly, noting that K is independent of s,\nDs​K=∂s∂K​+α,J∑​∂uJα​∂K​∂s∂uJα​​=α,J∑​∂uJα​∂K​∂J​Pα.\nSince Dt​P=Ds​K we then obtain\n∂t∂P​=α,J∑​∂uJα​∂K​∂J​Pα−α,J∑​∂uJα​∂P​∂J​Kα.(1)\n\nRosencrans’ article actually has a vectorialization of q-tupled functions P=(P1,…,Pq) which associates an operator V(P) to P through\nV(P)=J∑​∂J​P⋅∂J​=α,J∑​∂J​Pα⋅∂Jα​.\nUsing this vectorialization, Equation(1) then reads\n∂t∂P​=V(P)K−V(K)P.(2)\n\nNow, P is a q-tuple with components Pα, hence it is also identifiable with its evolutionary vector field vP​. We can think of this identification as expanding P over the basis {∂uα​}. Equation (2) finally becomes the desired symmetry notion from Olver’s text:\n∂t∂vP​​+[vP​,vK​]=0\nsince one can do the aforementioned identification on the summands involving the partials of K and P as well."},"Test_folder/index":{"title":"Test folder","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"index":{"title":"Research notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is my repository for my research notes.
