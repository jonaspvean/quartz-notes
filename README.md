# Addendum for my website

These are my notes for my al-folio-themed GitHub Pages site, which can be found [here](jonaspvean.github.io/notes/public). This is built with a modified Quartz 4.0, where 
- the navbar from the al-folio theme is included
- custom colour schemes are included and integrated with light- and darkmode
- and the repo is used as a main branch for a git submodule that exists in both the master and gh-pages branches of my [website](https://github.com/jonaspvean/jonaspvean.github.io)

TODO:
- add the progress bar scroll logic from the al-folio site
- resolve the issue of what happens to the page elements that break upon loading al-folio pages after having loaded the research notes page

# Quartz v4

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.
